	<ul>
	  <li>Users are able to have packages and mail inserted into their mailbox and are prompted with a notification through a webpage.</li>
	  <br>
	  <li>I was responsible for designing the inital project concept and developing the hardware design.</li>
	  <br>
	  <li>I also assisted my team members in implementing the hardware, developing the nofication webpage and the logging of the notifications.</li>
	  <br>
	  <li>Each log contained a time stamp of when the mail arrived and it was removed.</li>
	  <br>
	  <li>We used an Arduino Uno to tie all of the different components together and I helped with the testing of the Ardiuno code.</li>

	<ul>
	  <li>This is a web application that allows users to post in a forum-like environment about their university classes.</li>
	  <br>
	  <li>I designed the database and user interface concept.</li>
	  <br>
	  <li>Both me and one of my other teammates were responsible for handling backend environment.</li>
	  <br>
	  <li>Some of these things consisted of setting up the server and PHP logic.</li>
	  <br>
	  <li>We implemented our web application using a LAMP stack.</li>

      </a>
      <div class="project_content_div">
	<ul>
	  <li>After taking my discrete structure course, I became interested in the RSA algorithm.</li>
	  <br>
	  <li>I attempted to implement my own version of the RSA aglorithm as a hash function.</li>
	  <br>
	  <li>Using the hash function, I attempted to implement a hash table.</li>
	  <br>
	  <li>It was designed to be used for password encryption and decryption on other projects.</li>
	  <br>
	  <li>The final project could not be complete due to the constraints on memory required to correctly run the algorithm at the time.</li>
	  <br>
	  <li>Overall, I enjoyed working this project because it gave me a opportunity to try to utilize some of the materials that I learned in class.</li>
